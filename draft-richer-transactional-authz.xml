    <section title="Protocol">
      <t>This protocol allows a piece of software to request delegated
      authorization to an API, protected by an authorization server usually on
      behalf of a resource owner. The user operating the software may interact
      with the authorization server to authenticate, provide consent, and
      authorize the request.</t>

      <section title="Parties">
        <t>The Authorization Server (AS) manages the requested delegations. It
        is defined by its grant endpoint, a single URL that accepts a POST
        request with a JSON payload. The AS MAY also have other endpoints,
        including interaction endpoints and user code endpoints, and these are
        introduced to the RC as needed during the transaction process.</t>

        <t>The Resource Client (RC, aka "client") requests tokens from the AS
        and uses tokens at the RS.</t>

        <t>The Resource Server (RS) accepts tokens from the RC and validates
        them (potentially at the AS).</t>

        <t>The Resource Owner (RO) authorizes the request from the RC to the
        RS, often interactively at the AS.</t>

        <t>The Requesting Party (aka "user") operates the RC and may be the
        same party as the RO.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Sequences">
        <t>The RC requests access to an RS, and the AS determines that it
        needs to interact with the user directly to get the RO's consent:<list
            style="numbers">
            <t>The RC <xref target="request">creates a grant request and sends
            it to the AS</xref></t>

            <t>The AS <xref target="response">processes the grant request and
            determines if the RO needs to interact and sends its
            response</xref></t>

            <t>If interaction is required, the <xref
            target="user-interaction">AS interacts with the RO</xref>,
            possibly by directing the RC to send the RO there </t>

            <t>The RC <xref target="continue-request">continues the grant at
            the AS</xref></t>

            <t>The AS processes the transaction again, determining that a
            token can be issued</t>

            <t>The AS issues a token to the RC</t>

            <t>The RC uses the token with the RS</t>

        <t>If the client is requesting one or more access tokens for the

        an object (for multiple access tokens), as described in the following
        sections.</t>

          <t>When requesting a single access token, the client MUST send a
          resources element containing a JSON array. The elements of the JSON
          array represent rights of access that the client is requesting in
          the access token. The requested access is the sum of all elements
          within the array. These request elements MAY be sent by value as an
          object or by reference as a string. A single resources array MAY
          contain both object and string type resource requests.</t>

          <t>The client declares what access it wants to associated with the
          resulting access token using objects that describe multiple
          dimensions of access. Each object contains a <spanx style="verb">type</spanx>
          property that determines the type of API that the client is calling.
          The value of this field is under the control of the AS and it MAY
          determine which other fields allowed in the object. While it is
          expected that many APIs will have its own properties, a set of
          common properties are defined here. Specific API implementations
          SHOULD NOT re-use these fields with different semantics or syntax.

          the front channel response to an ongoing request by using values
          known only to the parties involved. This prevents several kinds of
          session fixation attacks against the client.</t>

          <t>To calculate the "hash" value, the party doing the calculation

          initial request</xref>, the AS's nonce value, and the "interact_ref"
          returned in the callback response. For a "callback" return, the AS
          nonce is the "callback_server_nonce" value in <xref
          target="response-interact-callback">the callback response</xref>,
          while for a "pushback" return the AS nonce is the
          "pushback_server_nonce" value in <xref
          target="response-interact-pushback">the pushback response</xref>.
          These three values are concatenated to each other in this order
          using a single newline character as a separator between the fields.
          There is no padding or whitespace before or after any of the lines,
          and no trailing newline character.</t>

    <section title="Discovery">
      <t>By design, the protocol minimizes the need for any pre-flight
      discovery. To begin a request, the RC only needs to know the endpoint of
      the AS and which keys it will use to sign the request. Everything else
      can be negotiated dynamically in the course of the protocol. </t>

      <t>However, the AS can have limits on its allowed functionality. If the
      RC wants to optimize its calls to the AS before making a request, it MAY
      send an HTTP OPTIONS request to the transaction endpoint to retrieve the
      server's discovery information. The AS MUST respond with a JSON document
      containing the following information:</t>

      <t><list style="hanging">
          <t hangText="grant_request_endpoint">REQUIRED. The full URL of the
          AS's grant request endpoint. This MUST match the URL the RC used to
          make the discovery request.</t>

          <t hangText="capabilities">OPTIONAL. A list of the AS's
          capabilities. The values of this result MAY be used by the RC in the
          <xref target="request-capabilities">capabilities section</xref> of
          the request.</t>

          <t hangText="interaction_methods">OPTIONAL. A list of the AS's
          interaction methods. The values of this list correspond to the
          possible fields in the <xref target="request-interact">interaction
          section</xref> of the request.</t>

          <t hangText="key_proofs">OPTIONAL. A list of the AS's supported key
          proofing mechanisms. The values of this list correspond to possible
          values of the <spanx style="verb">proof</spanx> field of the <xref
          target="request-key">key section</xref> of the request.</t>

          <t hangText="sub-ids">OPTIONAL. A list of the AS's supported
          identifiers. The values of this list correspond to possible values
          of the <xref target="request-subject">subject identifier
          section</xref> of the request.</t>

          <t hangText="assertions">OPTIONAL. A list of the AS's supported
          assertion formats. The values of this list correspond to possible
          values of the <xref target="request-subject">subject assertion
          section</xref> of the request.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The information returned from this method is for optimization
      purposes only. The AS MAY deny any request, or any portion of a request,
      even if it lists a capability as supported. For example, a given client
      can be registered with the <spanx style="verb">mtls</spanx> key proofing
      mechanism, but the AS also returns other proofing methods, then the AS
      will deny a request from that client using a different proofing
      mechanism.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Resource Servers">
      <t>In some deployments, a resource server will need to be able to call
      the AS for a number of functions.</t>

      <t>[[ Editor's note: This section is for discussion of possible advanced
      functionality. It seems like it should be a separate document or set of
      documents, and it's not even close to being well-baked. This also adds
      additional endpoints to the AS, as this is separate from the token
      request process, and therefore would require RS-facing discovery or
      configuration information to make it work. Also-also, it does presume
      the RS can sign requests in the same way that a client does, but
      hopefully we can be more consistent with this than RFC7662 was able to
      do. ]]</t>

      <section title="Introspecting a Token">
        <t>When the RS receives an access token, it can call the introspection
        endpoint at the AS to get token information. [[ Editor's note: this
        isn't super different from the token management URIs, but the RS has
        no way to get that URI, and it's bound to different keys. ]]</t>

        <t>The RS signs the request with its own key and sends the access
        token as the body of the request.</t>

        <t>The AS responds with a data structure describing the token's
        current state and any information the RS would need to validate the
        token's presentation, such as its intended proofing mechanism and key
        material.</t>

        <t>[[ Editor's note: this is similar to but based on the access token
        and not the grant. The fact that the keys presented are not the ones
        used for the access token should indicate that it's a different party

        authentication header indicating that GNAP. The address of the GNAP

        additionally return a resource reference that the client MAY use in

          <abstract>
            <t>Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer
            Security (DTLS) are widely used to protect data exchanged over
            application protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, POP, SIP, and
            XMPP. Over the last few years, several serious attacks on TLS have
            emerged, including attacks on its most commonly used cipher suites
            and their modes of operation. This document provides
            recommendations for improving the security of deployed services
            that use TLS and DTLS. The recommendations are applicable to the
            majority of use cases.</t>

    <section anchor="examples" title="Example Protocol Flows">
      <t>The protocol defined in this specification provides a number of
      features that can be combined to solve many different kinds of
      authentication scenarios. This section seeks to show examples of how the
      protocol would be applied for different situations.</t>

      <section title="Redirect-Based User Interaction">
        <t>In this scenario, the user is the RO and has access to a web
        browser, and the client can take front-channel callbacks on the same
        device as the user. This combination is analogous to the OAuth 2
        Authorization Code grant type.</t>

        approves the request. Since the AS has a callback parameter, the AS
        generates the interaction reference, calculates the hash, and

        validating session information and retrieves the stored pending
        request. The client uses the values in this to validate the hash
        parameter. The client then calls the continuation URL and presents the
        handle and interaction reference in the request body. The client signs
        the request as above.</t>

      <section title="Secondary Device Interaction">
        <t>In this scenario, the user does not have access to a web browser on
        the device and must use a secondary device to interact with the AS.
        The client can display a user code or a printable QR code. The client
        prefers a short URL if one is available.</t>

        <t>The client initiates the request to the AS.</t>

        <t>The AS processes this and determines that the RO needs to interact.
        The AS supports both long and short redirect URIs for interaction, so
        it includes both. Since there is no "callback" the AS does not include
        a nonce, but does include a "wait" parameter on the continuation
        section because it expects the client to poll for results.</t>

        <t>The client saves the response and displays the user code visually
        on its screen along with the static device URL. The client also
        displays the short interaction URL as a QR code to be scanned. The
        client ignores the longer interaction URL because both the long and
        short ones </t>

        <t>If the user scans the code, they are taken to the interaction
        endpoint and the AS looks up the current pending request based on the
        incoming URL. If the user instead goes to the static page and enters
        the code manually, the AS looks up the current pending request based
        on the value of the user code. In both cases, the user logs in, is
        identified as the RO for the resource being requested, and approves
        the request. Once the request has been approved, the AS displays to
        the user a message to return to their device.</t>

        <t>Meanwhile, the client periodically polls the AS every 60 seconds at
        the continuation URL.</t>

        <t>The AS processes this and determines that the RO needs to interact.
        The AS determines that it can reach the identified user asynchronously
        and that the identified user does have the ability to approve this
        request. The AS indicates to the client that it can poll for
        continuation.</t>

        <t>The AS reaches out to the RO and prompts them for consent. In this
        example, the AS has an application that it can push notifications in
        to for the specified account. </t>

        <t>Meanwhile, the client periodically polls the AS every 60 seconds at
        the continuation URL.</t>

        <t>The AS retrieves the pending request based on the handle and

        the client that no access token has yet been issued but it can

      <section title="Applying OAuth 2 Scopes and Client IDs">
        <t>In this scenario, the client developer has a client_id and set of
        scope values from their OAuth 2 system and wants to apply them to the
        new protocol. Traditionally, the OAuth 2 client developer would put
        their client_id and scope values as parameters into a redirect request
        to the authorization endpoint.</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[HTTP 302 Found
Location: https://server.example.com/authorize
  ?client_id=7C7C4AZ9KHRS6X63AJAO
  &scope=read%20write%20dolphin
  &redirect_uri=https://client.example.net/return
  &response_type=code
  &state=123455
]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t/>

        <t>Now the developer wants to make an analogous request to the AS
        using the new protocol. To do so, the client makes an HTTP POST and
        places the OAuth 2 values in the appropriate places.</t>

        <figure>
          <artwork><![CDATA[POST /tx HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com

    "resources": [
        "read", "write", "dolphin"
    ],
    "key": "7C7C4AZ9KHRS6X63AJAO",
    "interact": {
        "redirect": true,
        "callback": {
            "uri": "https://client.example.net/return?state=123455",
            "nonce": "LKLTI25DK82FX4T4QFZC"
        }
    }
}]]></artwork>
        </figure>

        <t/>

        <t>The client_id can be used to identify the client's keys that it
        uses for authentication, the scopes represent resources that the
        client is requesting, and the redirect_uri and state value are
        combined into a callback URI that can be unique per request. The
        client additionally creates a nonce to protect the callback, separate
        from the state parameter that it has added to its return URL.</t>

        <t>From here, the protocol continues as above.</t>
